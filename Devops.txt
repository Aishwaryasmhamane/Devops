****DeVops:
**docker
**git
**terafrom

*Git hub:
create repository (repo: application store)

Devops:
-is a methodlogy(different methods to create anything)

**Service & Microservice :
-Service: means it a pavkage of code which package and deployed  i.e. Monolithic
- Microservices: collection of services which is converted into micro size and deploying it . i.e. Microlithic 
-monolithic Architure :if architure is stored in single file used for small scale Achitecture , smiple to deploy and undersatnd 
-microlithic Architure : 4 different code with different page with diff file  , it is realibale(it will able to stay for longer time ) securtiy scalablity

**Git bash  install 
**Vscode 
**Gitand Github: (github is colud where we store our all git rep and versions )
-Git:  version control system. to manage the all versions is know as VcS.
used for tracking code changes.
used to check who made chnages .

-Github: github makes tools that use git

**visual studio code:
new file
** need to start the git  in VS code : git init (initilization) , ls -a 
*********************************************************************************************
-Git:  version control system. to manage the all versions is know as VcS.

used to check who made chnages .

- create file: touch like.txt
-git status :git mangining which files.
-we need to create untracked filr to trck file : git add like.txt / git add.(add.  meansall txt files)
-then agian git status 
-for track the file need to stage the file with git add file name .
-after adding the file: git commit -m(-m for message) "any message"
-git status
-git log: display logs , meanslog entry ,what we did . it will display the commit.
- if we have to addany text on stage file that will not take we need to agin stage the file.
-unstage : git restore --staged file name : to unsatge the stage file.

***Git Hub:
-git config --global user.email "email id " :need to congifg
-git config --global user.name"username"

-we need  to clone the repositroy in visual code :git  clone url for the file.
-if we want make a remote repositroy locally we will use git clone 
- README.mdfile: instruction file.
-fork : copy of repositroy
- push to github: git push origin (origin : will use defalut world)
- need to reomte the file:
-pull request

**Branching:
-when we initilize a git there is defalut branch.
-every file work in main/master branch.
-first we willcreate on txt file /sorce code then we will spilt thatcode in diff branches for diff purpose like development testing etc.
- after completion of all the opreations like devlope testing we will  marge that to main brache.
-overall we are doing the braching to protect our main branch form amy kind of harm / faliure
