****DeVops:
**docker
**git
**terafrom

*Git hub:
create repository (repo: application store)

Devops:
-is a methodlogy(different methods to create anything)

**Service & Microservice :
-Service: means it a pavkage of code which package and deployed  i.e. Monolithic
- Microservices: collection of services which is converted into micro size and deploying it . i.e. Microlithic 
-monolithic Architure :if architure is stored in single file used for small scale Achitecture , smiple to deploy and undersatnd 
-microlithic Architure : 4 different code with different page with diff file  , it is realibale(it will able to stay for longer time ) securtiy scalablity

**Git bash  install 
**Vscode 
**Gitand Github: (github is colud where we store our all git rep and versions )
-Git:  version control system. to manage the all versions is know as VcS.
used for tracking code changes.
used to check who made chnages .

-Github: github makes tools that use git

**visual studio code:
new file
** need to start the git  in VS code : git init (initilization) , ls -a 
*********************************************************************************************
-Git:  version control system. to manage the all versions is know as VcS.
used for tracking code changes.
used to check who made chnages .

- create file: touch like.txt
-git status :git mangining which files.
-we need to create untracked filr to trck file : git add like.txt / git add.(add.  meansall txt files)
-then agian git status 
-for track the file need to stage the file with git add file name .
-after adding the file: git commit -m(-m for message) "any message"
-git status
-git log: display logs , meanslog entry ,what we did . it will display the commit.
- if we have to addany text on stage file that will not take we need to agin stage the file.
-unstage : git restore --staged file name : to unsatge the stage file.

***Git Hub:
-git config --global user.email "email id " :need to congifg
-git config --global user.name"username"

-we need  to clone the repositroy in visual code :git  clone url for the file.
-if we want make a remote repositroy locally we will use git clone 
- README.mdfile: instruction file.
-fork : copy of repositroy
- push to github: git push origin (origin : will use defalut world)
- need to reomte the file:
-pull request

**Branching:
-when we initilize a git there is defalut branch.
-every file work in main/master branch.
-first we willcreate on txt file /sorce code then we will spilt thatcode in diff branches for diff purpose like development testing etc.
- after completion of all the opreations like devlope testing we will  marge that to main brache.
-overall we are doing the braching to protect our main branch form amy kind of harm / faliure
-create file n VS
- git init : after initializing the file will convert to repositrory.
-ls -a
-git branch : create branch main & dev
-git add source code : staging file
-git status
-git commit -m 'Source code file'
-add any thing in Sorce code of VS
-create branch : gitbranch dev
-we need to switch to that branch : git checkout branch name.
-to see we are in which bracnch : git branch.
-to read cat file name
-stage the file: git add soure code
-git commit -m "git change"
-git status
-create repositroy in github : source code 
-git push origin 
-ls
-ls-a
-git clone code link of repo.: to fetch the  remote repo to local
-ls
- cd source code
- also create a folder VS as sorce code.
- commit , status, stage
- create the branch  main/dev
- marge : dev to main : we need to switch to that branch  which we want to marge- git checkout dev-git marge main
- git push origin  existing branch /dev
-origin : remote repositroy url . for e.g git push origin dev means it will pushing the dev branch in our repository.
-git push origin main
-local to remote : push
- remote to local: clone
** virtulization:
-we have  physical hard ware which that having OS and Os having hypervisor and then whole systems have a different os/virtualmachines .
-incase ofAWS  we are having virtual hardware and operating sysetem but they didn't contain hypervisor amd then having oS 1 2.....
- when we are using an colud virtualization its more better than physical because we can adjust the space according to our choice.

***Docker:
-docker is OS level application tool.
- docker is a container (software in pacakges ) creating tool .
- dockers make s environment similar for each team memeber working on application.
-docker will create a container without os means  if we are facing an any issue for an any enviroment with the application then docker can create the caontainer i.e. docker file and that file can devoped in the others system which will porovide the same environment as we have.
-the software that host the container is called enginex.
-image :
-install docker on ubantu.
*install docker in aws:
-Ec2-instance- create-instance
-docker run :cmd
- docker ps: it wills show running container
-docket p -a : it will show running existing conatiners.
-the interaction with OS is not more for docker .


1.what is conatiner 
2 what is advantages of conatiner over a physical linux machine or virtual machine.
3.docker architure.

* cnatianer :
- it is light weight vrtual machine which doesnt have operating machine 
- container is a process ,lighweight .
-container starts in second.
-fast
-conatiner is lsocalated environment means its secure .
*** Step to insatll docker in ubuntu :
1.Set up Docker's apt repository:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
2.Install the Docker packages:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
3.Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:
sudo docker run hello-world

** docker achitrcture:
-dockerfile converts into docker image with help of docker run cmd  this all process in running on docker engine
-there are two parts in docker engine  1.docker client 2. docker server/host 3.docker registry. 
1.docker client :
-conatin docker run, docker build, docker pull . it conatin demone.
2.docker host/client :
-it contais contaianers 
3.registry
- it stores docker images .

*Docker demone
**********************************
-cd domwolads and copy the link of instance created in aws
- sudo docker ps : docker process
-to existance container and also the process which are running inbackground  : sudo docker ps-a
-sudo docker run nginx : to start the nginx
-sudo docker run -d nginx(-d : diattache form forground process) : conatiner will run in background.
- container ip : sudo docker inspect conatiner id 
- to access the link or url : curl
-nginx tcp port :80
-if Exitcode : 0 menas the process is sucessfully exicuted.
-to check wheather the process or cmd is sucessfully exicuted or not : echo $? (echo : used to print output)
-sudo docker kill container id : to kill process / container
- to stop any container: sudo docker stop container id
-to start any container : sudo docker start conatiner id : the status is up 
-sudo docker images : to see all images
- to remove the image/conatiner : sudo docker rm conatiner id
-first need to stop the conatiner before delete : sudo docker stop conatner id 
-sudo docker run --name name of service nginx : to give name to any  service 
- to create container :sudo docker run
-sudo docker run(docker run : to create conatiner ) -it  (intercat) nginx /bin/bash (shell)
-nginx files: cd/usr/share/ngix/html
-cat file form nginx: it will read file
-sudo docker exec -it conatiner id  shell /bash : to switch to that conatiner root user
-sudo vim index.html file : create one html file
-to copy paste the html file form local to conatiner : sudo dockercp ./index.html conatinerid:/usr/share/html/index.html
-sudo doxker inspect conatiner id : take ip of conatiner
-if the conatiner is not running or / not able to curl need to forward port:
-sudo docker run -p 8080:80 -d nginx (-p : port mapping/forwarding): add this port to instance in aws (we can directly access that file form form instance ip )
- to entre in conatiner : sudo docker exec --it container id shell /bash
